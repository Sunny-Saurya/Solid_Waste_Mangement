			<h2>The Solid Waste Problem</h2>
			<p>Solid waste management is the process of collecting, transporting, processing, recycling, and disposing of solid waste materials in a way that is safe, efficient, and environmentally sound. It involves a range of activities, including waste reduction, reuse, and recycling, as well as the use of landfills, incineration, and other disposal methods.
<br><br><br>
                Effective solid waste management is essential for protecting public health, preventing environmental pollution, and conserving natural resources. It involves a complex set of technical, economic, social, and political challenges, and requires the cooperation and involvement of a wide range of stakeholders, including governments, businesses, communities, and individuals.
                <br><br>
                The goals of solid waste management include reducing the amount of waste generated, minimizing the environmental impact of waste disposal, promoting resource conservation, and protecting public health and safety. To achieve these goals, solid waste management systems must be well-designed, well-managed, and well-funded, and must be integrated into broader systems of resource management and environmental protection.</p>

		<section id="causes">
			<h2>Causes of Solid Waste</h2>
			<p>There are several factors contributing to the solid waste problem in our college campus. Some of the main causes include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> <b>Overconsumption and wasteful practices:</b> One of the primary causes of solid waste is overconsumption and wasteful practices. This includes the production and consumption of disposable products, excessive packaging, and the use of single-use items.</li>
				<li><b>Population growth and urbanization:</b> Rapid population growth and urbanization are also major contributors to solid waste. As cities expand and populations increase, the amount of waste generated also increases, putting pressure on waste management systems.</li>
				<li> <b>Lack of waste management infrastructure:</b> In many parts of the world, there is a lack of adequate waste management infrastructure, including collection, transportation, and disposal facilities. This can result in the accumulation of waste in public spaces, leading to environmental and health hazards</li>
				<li> <b>Inadequate waste segregation and recycling:</b> In many cases, waste is not properly segregated at the source, making it difficult to recycle or recover valuable materials. This can result in the loss of resources and the need for more landfill space.</li>
				<li> <b>Illegal dumping and littering:</b> Illegal dumping and littering are also significant contributors to solid waste. This can result in the accumulation of waste in public spaces, as well as the contamination of soil and water resources.</li>
				<li><b>Economic factors:</b> Economic factors, such as the cost of waste disposal and the lack of incentives for waste reduction and recycling, can also contribute to solid waste management challenges.</li>
